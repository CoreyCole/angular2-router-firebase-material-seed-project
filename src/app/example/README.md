# About this component
This component was generated for you, don't worry you don't have to setup every component by hand!
Simply do the follow: `ng g component <your-component>`
Try to use hyphen-case and dont include the word `component` in your component's name as it is appended by the generator
The command you used was `ng g(or generate) <object-type> <object-name>`

## Before-use
